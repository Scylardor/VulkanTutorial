# VulkanTutorial
My version of Vulkan Tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde

This is a repo I made while following the [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com), step by step.

I ended up having much of the same code, except some parts that I changed for more optimized alternatives (I believe).

The code is also filled with comments (excerpts from the tutorial) that act as reminders of why some non-trivial operations are done, or how.

Also, I completely removed any exceptions from the code and replaced them with good old asserts (because why not).

Finally, there are also a lot of TODOs to remind me that a lot of things in this tutorial code can definitely be improved in the long run (it can't be used as is).
